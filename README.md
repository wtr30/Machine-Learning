# Machine-Learning
This is a repository for all machine learning projects I work on
This project was a work project done for school. It showcases Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression Algorithms inside of python to predict future match outcomes of the Volleyball Nations League. This project is by no means perfect as it is my first one, and my first real project in python. I am hoping to have this as a 'reference' point for myself moving forward in this environment to see how much I grow within this area.

Feed back is always welcome!
